Gaussian Distribution : Normal Distribution with given mean and standard deviation where values cluster around mean with fewer extreme values on either side

Power Law Distribution : Highly skewed with a long tail where most values are small, but a few very large values
- exponent parameter 'a' controls the decay rate of probabilities
- ex. wealth distribution, earthquake magnitudes
- models phenomena where large events dominate distribution like network traffic
- smaller a values lead to higher probability of generating very large values and larger value for a make distribution decay more steeply, concentrating values closer to lower bound

Geometric Distribution : Models the number of trials needed for first success in Bernoulli Process
- controlled by probability 'p', where smaller p values lead to longer trials
- Heavily skewed with most values near 1 but with a potential for large outliers.
- ex. flipping coins, manufacturing defects
- smaller p value means probability of success is very low per trial, and it takes more trials on average to achieve the first success, resulting in a long-tailed distribution whereas large value leads to distribution that is more concentrated near 1

1) Divide by Maximum Value
- scales values to range [0, 1]
- large outliers will disproportionately affect after scaling
- B : Values are scaled down but relative distribution retained
- I : Heavy tail will dominate the scale, smaller values are compressed
- H : Long tail (large values) is scaled down but may still dominate due to the discrete nature

2) Divide by Sum
- scales variable as proportion ( relative contribution of each value to the total )
- total sum of all normalized values will be always  1
- B : Original spread is somewhat retained
- I : High-valued tail dominates, smaller values become negligible.
- H : Large discrete values (tail) heavily affect normalization.

3) Z-score Normalization
- centers data to have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1
- highlights relative deviation from mean
- B : Retains the symmetric, bell-shaped structure
- I : Strongly skewed distribution remains
- H : Large positive skew will still exist but centered at 0

4) Percentile Normalization
- converts each value into its rank percentile
- robust to outliers and emphasizes relative positioning rather than magnitude hence useful for skewed and non-linear distributions
- B : Symmetry is preserved but magnitude is ignored
- I : Equalized contribution of extreme and small values, reducing skew
- H : Handles discrete and heavily skewed nature

5) Median Adjustment
- aligns median of all variables to a common value
- B : Median-centered, distribution retains shape
- I : Skew remains but central value aligns with others
- H : Long tail becomes less dominant

6) Quantile Normalization
- forces all variables to have same distribution by matching quantiles
- B : Distribution may slightly distort
- I : Heavy-tailed structure adjusted to match others
- H : Discrete nature adjusts to fit common distributions
